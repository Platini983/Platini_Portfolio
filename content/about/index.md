{{< figure src="/images/platini2.jpg" title="Data Science Enthusiat And React Dev" >}}

Data Science and React Dev are my passions. My name is Amponsah Michael and I have been working in the data science field doing a lot of analysis, research and projects for the last 2 years. I see how some people were very far off in their prediction about the current day, but others came very close, and those were the one that inspired me to continue in this field. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost.But now I want to push the boundaries and bring forth ideas and creations in the future.
