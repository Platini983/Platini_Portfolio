title: "Project 2: End To End Emotion Classifier"
---

For this example project is a Emotion classifier to predict the emotion from text. This could be useful for someone who is new to NLP from a certain country. A model was build using LogisticRegression pipeline. The model was imported using Joblib and the main application was build using streamlit.

I was able to get the model to predict the emotion of someone text with 62% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app.
